Sorry.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n===========\r\nClearly the only place to put stickynotes is on a whiteboard, so:\r\n\r\n    var whiteboard = new Whiteboard();\r\n\r\nThe Whiteboard constructor takes an optional jQuery selector to confine the whiteboard to a particular section of page, defaulting to 'body'.\r\n\r\n    var whiteboard = new Whiteboard('#whiteboard');\r\n\r\nInteractions\r\n===========\r\nInteractions with the stickynotes have been optimized for creation speed and cheapness.\r\n\r\nClick anywhere on the whiteboard at any time to create a new sticky note and start editing.\r\n\r\nWhile editing, `enter` submits changes and `esc` cancels changes.\r\n\r\nWhile not editing, hover over the stickynote with the mouse and press one of `y`, `b`, `r`, `g`, `p`, `m`, `c`, `t`, or `w` to change the color of the stickynote.\r\n\r\n![stickynote colors](http://i.imgur.com/zCIjKnJ.gif)\r\n\r\nDrag a sticky note to move it.  Double click on a sticky note to delete it.\r\n\r\nIt takes a little getting used to, since usually you click outside the note to submit/cancel changes.  Once you get used to it, though, this way is much faster.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
